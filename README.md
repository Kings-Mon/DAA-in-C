**Design and Analysis of Algorithms** covers the concepts of designing an algorithm as to solve various problems in computer science and information technology, and also analyse the complexity of these algorithms designed. The main aim of designing an algorithm is to provide a optimal solution for a problem.
Here some codes of data structures maintaining proper algorithms that are written in C.
